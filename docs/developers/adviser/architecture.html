  <div class="section" id="thoth-s-architecture">
<span id="architecture"></span><h1>Thoth’s architecture<a class="headerlink" href="#thoth-s-architecture" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>In this section, the reader gets a notion about Thoth architecture, requirements
for deployment and main Thoth’s components.</p>
<p>The whole deployment is divided into multiple namespaces (or OpenShift
projects) - <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-frontend</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-middletier</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-backend</span></code>,
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspection-api</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">inspection</span></code>, <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-graph</span></code> namespace and
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-infra</span></code> namespace.</p>
<a class="reference external image-reference" href="/assets/architecture.png"><img alt="Architecture overview diagram." src="/assets/architecture.png" /></a>
<p>Some of the components are deployed multiple times. They serve the same
purpose, but are parametrized - e.g. based on the namespace they operate on.
For example <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">cleanup-job</span></code>, responsible for cleaning a namespace, is deployed
into <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-frontend-stage</span></code> two times to clean resources in
<code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-middletier</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-backend</span></code>. This is shown in the architecture
overview as a rectangle with curly braces donating the namespace.</p>
<p>The main reason behind splitting the application into multiple namespaces are
workloads.  Thoth is running different type of one-time workloads based on an
trigger - for example a single <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">adviser</span></code> instance is created as per user
request. The workload is is then scheduled into a separate namespace (backend,
in case of adviser) and the given namespace acts as a pool of resources that
are available to be used for workloads. Other namespaces, for example frontend,
can be still used to scale, build, re-deploy or manage components.</p>
<div class="section" id="infra-namespace">
<h2>Infra Namespace<a class="headerlink" href="#infra-namespace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This namespace is separated for “infrastructure” related bits - for example all
the OpenShift templates are provisioned into this namespace. Also, the
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/thoth-ops">thoth-ops</a> (the link might be to
a private repo available only for Thoth developers) container responsible for
managing a Thoth deployment is created in this namespace.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="frontend-namespace">
<h2>Frontend Namespace<a class="headerlink" href="#frontend-namespace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-frontend</span></code> is used as a management namespace. Services running in
this namespace have usually assigned a service account for running and managing
pods that are available inside the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-middletier</span></code> and <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">thoth-backend</span></code>
namespaces.</p>
<p>A user can interact with the user-facing API that is the key interaction point
for users or bots. <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/user-api">The user-facing API</a> specifies its endpoints using
Swagger/OpenAPI specification. See <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/thamos">Thamos repo and documentation - a library
and CLI for interacting with Thoth</a>
and <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/user-api">the user API service repo</a>
itself for more info. You can also find more info in the <a class="reference internal" href="integration.html#integration"><span class="std std-ref">integration</span></a> section.</p>
<p>Besides user API, there are run periodically CronJobs that keep application in
sync and operational:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/cleanup-job">cleanup-job</a> - a job
responsible for cleaning up resources left in the cluster</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/graph-refresh-job">graph-refresh-job</a> - -
a job responsible for scheduling analyses of packages that were not yet
analyzed</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/graph-sync-job">graph-sync-job</a> - a job
responsible for syncing data in a JSON format persisted on Ceph to the Thoth’s
knowledge graph database</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/package-releases-job">package-releases-job</a> - a job responsible
for tracking new releases on Python’s package index (the public one is
<a class="reference external" href="https://pypi.org">PyPI.org</a>, see also
<a class="reference external" href="https://tensorflow.pypi.thoth-station.ninja/">AICoE index</a>)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/cve-update-job">cve-update-job</a> - a job
responsible for gathering CVE information about packages</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/workload-operator">workload-operator</a> -
an OpenShift operator responsible for scheduling jobs into namespaces, it
respects allocated resources dedicated for the namespace in which jobs run</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/graph-sync-operator">graph-sync-operator</a>
- an OpenShift operator responsible for scheduling graph-sync-jobs that sync
results of analyzer job runs into Thoth’s knowledge graph</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="middletier-namespace">
<h2>Middletier Namespace<a class="headerlink" href="#middletier-namespace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The middletier namespace is used for analyzes and actual resource hungry tasks
that compute results for Thoth’s knowledge graph. This namespace was separated
from the frontend namespace to guarantee application responsibility. All the
pods that require computing results for the knowledge graph are scheduled in
this namespace. This namespace has an allocated pool of resources for such
un-predicable amount of computational pods needed for this purpose (so pods are
not scheduled besides running user API possibly making user API
non-responsive).</p>
<p>A special service - <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/result-api">result API</a>
abstracts away any database operations (that can be possibly dangerous when
executing an untrusted code in Thoth’s solvers). Each analyzer that is run in
the middletier namespace serialises its results to a structured JSON format and
these results are submitted to the user API service that stores results in the
Ceph object storage. All results computed by Thoth are first stored in a JSON
format for later analyses and making the graph instance fully recoverable and
reconfigurable based on previous results.</p>
<p>Currently, there are run following analyzers in the <code class="docutils literal notranslate"><span class="pre">middletier</span></code> namespace:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/package-extract">package-extract</a> - an
analyzer responsible for extracting packages from runtime/buildtime
environments (container images)</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/solver">solver</a> - an analyzer run to
gather information about dependencies between packages (on which packages the
given package depends on?, what versions satisfy version ranges?) and gathers
observations such as whether the given package is installable into the given
environment and if it is present on a Python package index</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/dependency-monkey">dependency-monkey</a> -
an analyzer that dynamically constructs package stacks and submits them to
<a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/amun-api">Amun</a> for dynamic analysis (can
be the given stack installed?, what are runtime observations - e.g.
performance index?) (this is currently WIP)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="backend-namespace">
<h2>Backend Namespace<a class="headerlink" href="#backend-namespace" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The backend part of application is used for executing code that, based on
gathered information from analyzers run in the middletier namespace, compute
results for actual Thoth users (bots or humans).</p>
<p>This namespace has, as in the case of middletier namespace, allocated pool of
resources. Each time a user requests a recommendation, pods are dynamically
created in this namespace to compute results.</p>
<p>As of now, there are run following analyzers to compute recommendations for
a user:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser">adviser</a> - a recommendation
engine computing stack level recommendations for a user for the given runtime
environment</p></li>
<li><p><a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser">provenance-checker</a> - an
analyzer that checks for provenance (origin) of packages so that a user uses
correct packages from correct package sources (Python indexes) - note that
Python <a class="reference internal" href="compatibility.html#compatibility"><span class="std std-ref">packaging format does not guarantee this - neither  Pipenv nor pip
itself</span></a>! (the implementation now lies in the <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/adviser">adviser repo</a>)</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="section" id="id1">
<h2>Amun<a class="headerlink" href="#id1" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Amun is a standalone project within Thoth - it’s aim is to act as an execution
engine. Based on requests coming in from Thoth itself (dependency-monkey
jobs), it can build the requested application (create builds and image streams)
on requested runtime environment (a container base image with optionally
additional native packages installed in) and execute the supplied testsuite to
verify whether the given application stack works on targeted hardware (also
part of the dependency-monkey request). The result of Amun API are
“observations” from inspection jobs (build and run inspections). These
observations are subsequently synced into the knowledge graph as part of
graph-sync-job.</p>
<p>For more information, see <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/amun-api">Amun API repository</a> and autogenerated <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/amun-client">Amun client</a>.

cluster internal, without any route exposed to the world, build-watcher can
also cooperate with external registries. Documentation can be found in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/thoth-station/build-watcher">the

<div class="section" id="a-brief-history-of-thoth">
<h1>A brief history of Thoth<a class="headerlink" href="#a-brief-history-of-thoth" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Thoth started as an experiment in <a class="reference external" href="https://github.com/aicoe">AICoE</a> - a team
called “AI Center of Excellence” in Red Hat’s office of the CTO. During development,
the main database was exchanged multiple times. Initially, there was used
<a class="reference external" href="https://janusgraph.org/">JanusGraph database</a>. Even thought the JanusGraph database
served its purpose (storing graph related data), given the number of requests
performed by the application, JanusGraph did not scale well. Also, maintainability of
the JanusGraph instance was not satisfying given the team size (2 developers).
The next database used, <a class="reference external" href="https://dgraph.io/">Dgraph</a> addressed most of the issues
and led to a cooperation between Thoth team and AIOps team - you can <a class="reference external" href="https://next.redhat.com/2019/11/18/prometheus-anomaly-detection/">find more details
in this article</a>.
Unfortunately, we reached scalability issues of Dgraph instance and were forced to look
for another solution that would serve the main database purpose:</p>
<div class="admonition note">
<p class="admonition-title">Note</p>
<p>The term “graph” is used in Thoth’s sources all over the place. This term was
adopted as a “graph database” was initially used. Even though the main
database is not graph database anymore, Thoth’s knowledge base can still be
seen as a graph knowledge base - a database storing graph data not
necessarily in a graph form.</p>
</div>
<p>Another reason behind switching away from graph databases was Python ecosystem
size. The main query for obtaining dependencies (in the adviser and Dependency
Monkey implementation) initially retrieved the whole dependency graph at one
shot - this solution did not scale well for larger software stacks (such as
TensorFlow) and we were encountering serialization issues - when JanusGraph, as
well as Dgraph were used. The query had to be broken down into multiple requests
into Thoth’s knowledge base. At the end, we ended up with a query that could be
easily transformed into an SQL query with 3 joins.</p>
<p>Another part of Thoth, that was rewritten multiple times, is the core
recommendation algorithm. Initially, adviser and Dependency Monkey loaded the
whole dependency graph into memory and then, operations on a weighted N-ary
dependency graph were made. These operations guaranteed resolution of higher
scored packages faster during dependency graph traversals that were made to
resolve software stacks. This implementation was then rewritten into C/C++ to
gain performance. Unfortunately, the approach had to be abandoned given the
number of requests needed to be performed to obtain large software stacks (in
case of a TensorFlow stack, 2.5k requests were made just to obtain the
dependency graph that required a lot of time just to perform data transfer).
Considering <a class="reference external" href="https://stackoverflow.blog/2017/09/06/incredible-growth-python/">how Python ecosystem is growing</a>, this
solution would not scale well in the future.</p>
<p>All the above let to a transition to a more stochastic approach - the
implementation design of Thoth’s adviser supports this fact with <a class="reference internal" href="resolver.html#resolver"><span class="std std-ref">resolver</span></a>, <a class="reference internal" href="predictor.html#predictor"><span class="std std-ref">predictor</span></a> abstractions and a <a class="reference internal" href="pipeline.html#pipeline"><span class="std std-ref">stack
resolution pipeline</span></a> used for scoring and producing highly optimized
software stacks.</p>
